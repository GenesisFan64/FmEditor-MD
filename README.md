# FmEditor-MD
FM patch editor for Genesis/MegaDrive

This was designed to be used with the PulseMini sound driver


To save the patch use Fusion's savestates (.gsx)

And to use them on PulseMini: in your assembly code use binclude/incbin, set the START position at $2478 and the LENGTH to $20 bytes


Example:

    binclude "game/sound/instr/fm/bass_beach_2.gsx",2478h,20h

(instrument located at Z80)
